# Encrypt
Encrypt and decode


[*] This program works to encrypt and decrypt texts
    but the decryption key must be available

[*] Decryption key: It is a number that is specified when creating the encrypted 
    and is given to the second party to be able to decrypt the message

[*] To ensure that there are no problems
    it is best to use a key with a value less than 10

[*] If it does not work, try changing the encryption key
